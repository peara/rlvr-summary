Researchers analyzed satellite data from the past 20 years and found that glacial retreat has increased by 40% compared to previous decades. The study warns that this rapid melting could lead to significant sea level rise and impact freshwater supplies for billions of people. Arctic glaciers are melting fastest, followed by those in the Himalayas and Andes mountains.", "highlights": "New study shows glacier melting has accelerated 40% in past 20 years due to climate change.
